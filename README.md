This project was created for MS Visual Studio. It is written in plain C and so it should be compilable on other platforms.

This searches all possible arrangements of a 3x3 Rubik's Cube to find a scramble that meets these criteria:
1)	Every color appears on every face.
2)	No more than two squares of any color on a face.
3)	No two squares of the same color touching side-by-side on any face.
4)	No two squares of the same color touching on a corner on any face.
5)	No two squares of the same color touching on a corner where two faces meet.
6) A different pattern on every face.
